## ðŸ”§ Configuration Details

### Email Template Customization

The email template is in `src/services/email-simple.ts`. You can customize:

- **Colors and branding** - Update the CSS styles
- **Content** - Modify the HTML template
- **Layout** - Change the structure and styling

### Admin Email Detection

The system automatically finds admin emails from the `user_profiles` table:
- Looks for users with `role = 'admin'`
- Uses the first admin email found
- Logs errors if no admin email is found

### Error Handling

The email system is designed to be robust:
- Email failures won't break order creation
- All errors are logged to console
- Graceful fallback to logging mode

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test Components

1. **TestEmailSimple** (`/test-email-simple`)
   - Tests the email service directly
   - Shows admin setup instructions
   - Displays email content in console

2. **Real Order Testing**
   - Place orders through the main application
   - Check console for email logs
   - Verify admin dashboard shows orders

### Console Logs

Look for these messages in the browser console:
- `"Sending new order notification to: admin@email.com"`
- `"Email would be sent with content: ..."`
- `"Email notification logged successfully"`

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### No Admin Email Found
- Verify admin user exists in `user_profiles` table
- Check that `role = 'admin'` is set
- Ensure email address is valid

### Email Not Sending
