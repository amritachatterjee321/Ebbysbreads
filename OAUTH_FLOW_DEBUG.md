# OAuth Flow Debug - Current Issue

## 🚨 **Current Situation**
You're in the middle of a Google OAuth flow, but it appears to be getting stuck or not completing properly.

## 🔍 **What's Happening**

The URL you shared shows:
- ✅ Google OAuth is working (you reached Google's sign-in page)
- ✅ OAuth flow started successfully
- ❓ **Issue**: The flow might not be completing properly

## 🔧 **Immediate Steps**

### Step 1: Complete the OAuth Flow
1. **Complete the Google sign-in** on the page you're currently on
2. **Authorize the application** when prompted
3. **Wait for redirect** back to your application

### Step 2: Check for Errors
If the flow doesn't complete, look for:
- **"Redirect URI mismatch"** error
- **"Invalid Site URL"** error
- **Page not loading** after authorization

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for error messages during the OAuth flow

## 🐛 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### Issue 1: Redirect URI Mismatch
**Error:** "The redirect URI in the request does not match a registered redirect URI"

**Solution:**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
3. Edit your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
4. Add your production redirect URIs:

```
https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app/auth/callback
https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app/admin
```

### Issue 2: Supabase Configuration
**Error:** OAuth completes but user doesn't get signed in

**Solution:**
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to "Authentication" → "Settings"
3. Update "Site URL" to your production domain
4. Add production redirect URLs

### Issue 3: Environment Variables
**Error:** OAuth works but session doesn't persist

**Solution:**
1. Check Vercel environment variables
2. Ensure `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set correctly
3. Redeploy after changes

## 🔍 **Debugging Steps**

### Step 1: Check Current Status
1. **Complete the OAuth flow** you're currently in
2. **Note any error messages** that appear
3. **Check browser console** for specific errors

### Step 2: Use Built-in Debug Tools
After completing the flow, go to:
- `/oauth-debug` - Shows current OAuth configuration
- `/oauth-checker` - Checks production OAuth setup
- `/troubleshooter` - Provides specific solutions

### Step 3: Test in Incognito
1. Open an incognito browser window
2. Go to your production site
3. Try the OAuth flow again

## 📋 **What to Do Next**

### If OAuth Completes Successfully:
1. ✅ You should be redirected to `/admin`
2. ✅ You should see "Auth state changed: SIGNED_IN" in console
3. ✅ You should see your user information in the admin panel

### If OAuth Fails:
1. ❌ Note the exact error message
2. ❌ Check browser console for details
3. ❌ Use the debugging tools to identify the issue

## 💡 **Need Your Domain**

**Can you tell me your exact Vercel deployment URL?** This will help me give you the correct redirect URIs to add to your Google OAuth configuration.

**Example:**
```
https://ebbysbreads.vercel.app
https://ebbys-bakery.vercel.app
```

## 🚀 **Expected Result**

After fixing the configuration:
- ✅ OAuth flow completes without errors
- ✅ User is redirected back to admin panel
- ✅ Session is created and maintained
- ✅ User can access admin features

**Complete the OAuth flow you're currently in and let me know what happens!** 🔐
